Introduction link h2 This project is a fork of GitHub - mayfer/claude-app-generator-demo, which was a demonstration of Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s Claude 3 Opus generating an app in one go without errors. You can see a demonstration of the generation and the program here: murat on Twitter.
Why link h2 While the demonstration shows no errors, the instructions in the README were incomplete, and others had trouble with installing the dependencies.
I also thought it would be a neat alternative to texting people who are in the same area.</description></item><item><title>

A brief history link h2 A nerd snipe from a coworker link h3 My coworker nerd sniped me with this problem: Given a set of constraints, can you devise a way to create schedule for the FIRST LEGO League Challenge event we&amp;rsquo;re running later this year? I liked scheduling problems and solving puzzles so it piqued my interest.
Early attempts link h3 Since this was not a necessary project for my job, I started to work on the problem in my free time.</description></item><item><title>

Problem link h2 Logseq does not have a native way to view the character count of your notes (aka pages)
Logseq&amp;rsquo;s performance is a balance between the number of pages and the size of each page
Logseq&amp;rsquo;s graph is difficult to search and prune manually
Possible solution link h2 Encode Logseq&amp;rsquo;s graph to enable semantic search, then leverage this encoding to develop an automatic pruning tool of some kind.</description></item></channel></rss>
