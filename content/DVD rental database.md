## Requirements

  + Create a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) real-world business report using data extracted and analyzed from the [DVD Rental Database](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/)

  + Summarize the business report, ensuring it is answerable, useful to the business, and focused on a specific metric/dimension

  + Identify necessary data tables and specific fields required for both the detailed and summary sections of the report

  + Explain the transformation required for a specific field in the detailed section

  + Clarify the business uses of both report sections and the frequency at which the report should be refreshed

  + Develop SQL code for creating report tables, extracting raw data, applying data transformations, and creating a trigger to update the summary table automatically

  + Implement a stored procedure to refresh data in the report tables, including the ETL load process, with a clear schedule for execution
