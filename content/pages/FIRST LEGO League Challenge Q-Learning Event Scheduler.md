Designing, developing, and implementing a capstone project that incorporates machine learning and data visualization to address a specific business or organizational need.

## Learning Objectives and Requirements

  + ### Write a Letter of Transmittal and a Project Proposal

    + Create a compelling letter of transmittal and project proposal to convince senior, non-technical managers and executives to implement the data product.

    + The proposal should succinctly describe the problem, proposed solution, benefits to the organization, costs, timeline, data considerations, ethical concerns, and my relevant expertise.

  + ### Write an executive summary

    + Write an executive summary for IT professionals, detailing the technical context, project summary, data handling, implementation plan, timeline, evaluation methods, and resource and cost estimations.

  + ### Design and develop a data product

    + At least one descriptive method and one non-descriptive (predictive or prescriptive) method.

    + A mechanism to handle data collection, processing, and management.

    + Three different types of data visualizations integrated into a user-friendly dashboard.

    + Implementation of machine learning methods and algorithms.

  + ### Document the project's development

    + A detailed business vision and requirements document.

    + An overview of data sources, cleaning, preprocessing, and structure.

    + Detailed descriptions and justifications of the machine learning methods used.

    + A validation plan with results and assessments.

    + Visualizations and their purposes within the data product.

    + A user guide with installation and execution instructions.
