## Learning Objectives and Requirements
---

  + Migrate an existing student system to a new platform, focusing on data manipulation and student roster maintenance.

  + Develop a program with two main classes: `Student` and `Roster`, to manage student data and course enrollment.

  + Ensure the program reads and processes a list of five students, creating student objects from the provided data.

  + Store the student list in an array called `classRosterArray`, with specific output directed to the console.

  + Include essential student information like `ID`, `name`, `email`, `age`, `course completion days`, and `degree program`.

  + Modify the `StudentData` table as required, and create six specific files (`main.cpp,` `degree.h`, `student.h/cpp`, `roster.h/cpp`) with appropriate source and header separations.

  + Define an enumerated data type `DegreeProgram` with values `SECURITY`, `NETWORK`, and `SOFTWARE`.

  + Implement and use accessor and mutator functions in the `Student` class for data manipulation, along with a constructor and a print function.

  + Develop the `Roster` class to manage the student data array, including functions to add, remove, print, and manage student data based on specific criteria like degree program and average days in courses.

  + Demonstrate program functionality in `main.cpp` with specific function calls and logic to manage and display student data effectively, including handling invalid email addresses and specific student removal scenarios.

  + Implement memory management practices, ensuring the dynamic memory allocated in `Roster` is appropriately released.
