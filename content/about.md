## About me
Hello!

Personally, I'm interested in programming, making music, formal logic, backpacking, magic and [cardistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardistry), and cooking. This site is a collection of my projects and notes related to various areas of my life.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology.

I grew up in The Bronx, NYC where I started learning magic tricks at the age of 5, attended the [Lang Science Program](https://www.amnh.org/learn-teach/children-and-families/lang-science-program) at The American Museum of Natural History from the summer of fifth grade to high school graduation, built (awful) text-based games in BASIC, and where I eventually moved out of to pursue my higher education.
