## Purpose

My ErgoDox EZ came with some tenting legs, but they suffer from two main problems:

They are individually adjusted with thumbscrews, which can be finnicky

The maximum tenting may not be as extreme as you might like

With a custom tenting kit, I wanted to build one that's easily adjustable (one adjustment "move" per side of keyboard), and one that you can easily take the keyboard off of when desired. I chose LEGO because that's what I had on hand.

## Solutions

{{< logseq/orgWARNING >}}I never thought I'd be sharing this, so my photographical record keeping is lacking for several versions, which I will omit.

### 3D printing

I definitely would have experimented with the following if I had a 3D printer at home:

### Useful articles

The development story for the Dygma Raise's tenting kit was extremely helpful for the creation of the kit given here.
