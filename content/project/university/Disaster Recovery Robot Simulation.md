{{< / logseq/orgWARNING >}}

## Requirements

  + Familiarize with CoppeliaSim robotics virtual environment and tools

  + Thoroughly describe a disaster scenario and integrate at least two obstacles within this environment

  + Create or modify a robot equipped with at least two sensors to perform a specific disaster relief task

  + Justify the choice of sensors and modifications made to the robot's architecture, explaining how they contribute to the disaster recovery effort

  + Describe how the robot maintains an internal representation of the environment for decision-making

  + Explain the robot's implementation of reasoning, knowledge representation, uncertainty, and intelligence in achieving its goal

  + Discuss potential improvements for the prototype, including the application of reinforced learning and advanced search algorithms
