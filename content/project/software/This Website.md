## How It's Made

1. Pages (notes, articles, projects) are written in Logseq markdown.

2. Pages with a `public` property are exported and converted to Hugo markdown using the Logseq Schr√∂dinger plugin.

3. The exported `assets` and `pages` folders are placed in the `content` folder of this Hugo site.

4. `hugo -D` + `hugo serve -D` to build and serve the site locally.

5. GitHub Actions to serve the site publicly.
