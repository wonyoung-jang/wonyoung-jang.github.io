      <description>Draw in realtime on a blank canvas with others on the same server.
Introduction This project is a fork of GitHub - mayfer/claude-app-generator-demo, which was a demonstration of Anthropic&amp;rsquo;s Claude 3 Opus generating an app in one go without errors. You can see a demonstration of the generation and the program here: murat on Twitter.
Why Did I Fork This? While the demonstration shows no errors, the instructions in the README were incomplete, and others had trouble with installing the dependencies.</description>

      <description>This page is a meta presentation for the deployment of this website (and this page).
How It&amp;rsquo;s Made Pages (notes, articles, projects) are written in Logseq markdown.
Pages with a public property are exported and converted to Hugo markdown using the Logseq Schr√∂dinger plugin.
The exported assets and pages folders are placed in the content folder of this Hugo site.
hugo -D + hugo serve -D to build and serve the site locally.</description>

      <guid>https://wonyoungjang.org/pages/logseq-markdown-tokenizer/</guid>
      <description>Estimate the cost of tokenizing markdown files for OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s text-embedding models.
The Problem Logseq does not have a native way to view the character count of your notes (aka pages).
Logseq&amp;rsquo;s performance is a balance between the number of pages and the size of each page.
Logseq&amp;rsquo;s graph is difficult to search and prune manually.
Proposed Solution Encode Logseq&amp;rsquo;s graph to enable semantic search, then leverage this encoding to develop an automatic pruning tool of some kind.</description>
