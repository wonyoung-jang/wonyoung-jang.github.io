      <description>About Wonyoung Jang Hello, that&amp;rsquo;s me!
Personally, I&amp;rsquo;m interested in programming, making music, formal logic, backpacking, magic and cardistry, and cooking. This site is a collection of my projects and notes related to various areas of my life.
I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology.
I grew up in The Bronx, NYC where I started learning magic tricks at the age of 5, attended the Lang Science Program at The American Museum of Natural History from the summer of fifth grade to high school graduation, built (awful) text-based games in BASIC, and where I eventually moved out of to pursue my higher education.</description>
