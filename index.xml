Implementation If I want to enable semantic search, then I must embed my graph.</description></item><item><title>Package Delivery Route Optimization</title><link>https://wonyoungjang.org/project/university/package-delivery-route-optimization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@wonyoungjang.org (Wonyoung Jang)</author><guid>https://wonyoungjang.org/project/university/package-delivery-route-optimization/</guid><description>warning This project was completed for coursework and is no longer maintained.
