You can see a demonstration of the generation and the program here: murat on Twitter outbound .
Why While the demonstration shows no errors, the instructions in the README were incomplete, and others had trouble with installing the dependencies.</description></item><item><title>Wonyoungjang.org</title><link>https://wonyoungjang.org/project/software/wonyoungjang.org/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@wonyoungjang.org (Wonyoung Jang)</author><guid>https://wonyoungjang.org/project/software/wonyoungjang.org/</guid><description>How it&amp;rsquo;s made Pages (notes, articles, projects) are written in Logseq markdown.
Pages with a public property are exported and converted to Hugo markdown using the Logseq Schr√∂dinger plugin.
The exported assets and pages folders are placed in the content folder of this Hugo site.
hugo -D + hugo serve -D to build and serve the site locally.

I liked scheduling problems and solving puzzles so it piqued my interest.
Early attempts Since this was not a necessary project for my job, I started to work on the problem in my free time.</description></item><item><title>Save top level reddit comments</title><link>https://wonyoungjang.org/project/software/save-top-level-reddit-comments/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>contact@wonyoungjang.org (Wonyoung Jang)</author><guid>https://wonyoungjang.org/project/software/save-top-level-reddit-comments/</guid><description>Premise Sometimes I just want the top voted parent comments of a reddit post.

Logseq&amp;rsquo;s performance is a balance between the number of pages and the size of each page.
Logseq&amp;rsquo;s graph is difficult to search and prune manually.
Possible solution Encode Logseq&amp;rsquo;s graph to enable semantic search, then leverage this encoding to develop an automatic pruning tool of some kind.
Implementation If I want to enable semantic search, then I must embed my graph.</description></item></channel></rss>
